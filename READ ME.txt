Hello!

     Here you will find 3 releveant articles. 2 repositories containing coding projects and my resume.

1) A PDF of my Resume (pretty straight-forward)

2) POS system: This is a "work in progress" project I started about a week ago. It is important to note that while this is demonstative of my work,
that this is not a final product and does not accurately demonstrate what a final program from me will look like. To run presently as is, you can run
the program in the repository named "main" or run the program via opening files "main.cpp", "POS.cpp", and "POS.hpp" in any IDE 
(VS Code recommended) and building it manually that way. 

3) Data_Structures_ASMT_1 City Record Manager: This was a class project for data structures. This porject's aim was to have us make a city
record management system using both an application of an array and an application of linked list to reliably see the difference in performance 
between the two and the data structurs' individual strengths and weaknesses. I include this in my submission because my POS system program is 
still incomplete, hence, it does not accurately display a final product produced by myself. This program, however, does demonstrate what a final 
product produced my me looks like. Again, to run this program, you can either run the "main" in the ASMT_1 repository, or load "main.cpp",
"Assmt_1.cpp", and "Assmt_1.hpp" in an IDE and builing it manually.

NOTE* both POS and ASMT_1 have self explainitory function within them, using the console to input commands, SO no further explination is needed
in their usage.
